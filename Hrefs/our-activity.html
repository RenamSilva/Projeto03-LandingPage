          <h1>Increases Logical Thinking with Coding Class</h1>
          <p>
            Having logical thinking skills encourages kids to think for
            themselves, to question assumptions, to develop their own theories,
            and to test their theories against known facts. These thinking skills
            are transferable to all situations.
